# Data Analysis for Diabetes Prediction
## Abstract
This project is centered on independently mastering data analysis techniques by developing a diabetes prediction model using public data. Utilizing Python and machine learning methodologies, I will preprocess and scale the data while training models to accurately identify risk patterns. The project will also involve thorough data analysis, system optimization, and performance evaluation to enhance my understanding of practical algorithm applications and explore their potential. Ultimately, this endeavor aims to broaden my knowledge in computer science by aligning with current technological trends and investigating technologies that can benefit the public good.
## Creation Period
The development of this initiative is currently ongoing, spanning from September 2024 to December 2024.
